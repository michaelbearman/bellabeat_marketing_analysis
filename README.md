The Bellabeat Marketing Analysis is the second case study of Googleâ€™s Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The case study requires the analyst to follow to the steps of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act) for a dataset that represents a fictional company (Cyclistic Bike-Share). I utilized SQL, R, and Google Sheets in this case study.
